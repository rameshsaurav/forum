                        Chinese officials say the country’s rapid economic development in the years since what they call the “political turmoil” of 1989 proves that decisions made at the time were correct.

                        <p>The statement doesn't even make sense, as if China is the only country which has ever experienced growth. I don't know how Chinese people can read this and not be like "ok, but doesn't the west have prosperity and political freedom?"

                            Like the whole thing kind of implies that Chinese people are so inferior somehow that they can't do both?</p>

                        And China’s economic growth is a result of the CCP integrating the Chinese economy into the global market and transitioning away from a planned economy model. The Tiananmen Square protestors weren’t resisting this; they were pushing for political freedom and the institutionalisation of their own civic and democratic activities alongside the new economic freedoms.
